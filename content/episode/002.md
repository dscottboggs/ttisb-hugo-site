2.5 Admins walks us through the basics of stock trading, shorts and squeezes, while podcasts Trashfuture and Chapo Trap House weigh in on the implications of who is and isn’t allowed to artificially drive the prices of stock up or down. Who makes the rules, who is allowed to break them, and most importantly to us, WHY?

But first, in order to understand the conditions that led to the emergence of financialization and eventually the past month’s Gamestop and related stock reaction madness, we’re going to hear some more from Dr. Richard Wolff about capitalism’s development in the American colonies, and what exactly went down in the 1970s that drastically changed the material conditions of the working class here in America.
